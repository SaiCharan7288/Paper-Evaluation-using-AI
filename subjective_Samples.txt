A pointer is a variable which can be used to save memory address of another variable or data structure. Pointers are used in programming 
languages like C and C++ to manage memory and access data. Pointers are similar to other variables, but they store a memory address
instead of a value. Pointers are declared by placing * mark in front of the variable name.
